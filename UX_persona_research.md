UX Persona hypotheses

3 Personas;

    - Holly Matteo   
        In her late 20s/early 30s, has an active lifestyle (enjoys running, being outside, eating healthy, etc). Single, lots a friends (outgoing), has a dog at home. Used to be on high school/college swim teams (mostly did it for the social aspect). Usually uses apps/social media like Facebook and Instagram. 
        Uses app every Thursday/Friday and weekends to check/plan upcoming meets and assign swimmers to best strokes. Sees recreational team more as a social "fun" experience, less for competitive reasons.

    - Joe Pokey
        Young adult in his early 20s. Started recreational swim team in college for an extra curriculum activity. Not part of a Frat house, but is a big socialite on campus. Get's average grades, usually playing video games or football with dormmates.
        Has a competitive side, likes the thought of his team winning, and wouldn't mind becoming a swim coach later on in life (his dad was his little league soccer coach). The type to check app regularly and strategize his teams, and the opposing teams stats. Likes to have regular practices with team.

    - Randy Grace
        Mid to late 30s. Randy is part of a leisure recreational swim team for the health benefits. Her team is mainly older woman with families who are looking for a social activity that also doubles as exercise. She, and her fellow moms aren't shy when it comes to competition, but aren't about the sport for the glory. Most of their families are their audience during meets, and after each meet all the families go out for food or a picnic together.
        Randy is the "captain," but really she's more of the "face of the team." A lot of decisions are made as a team, and less with one person calling all the shots.

One of her swimmers, Barry, just emailed saying that his kid has their own game going on at the time of the swim meet and he can't swim this weekend.
