Used to be on high school/college swim teams (mostly did it for the social aspect). Usually uses apps/social media like Facebook and Instagram.

1 Feature; Planning/Scheduling an upcoming meet

User Story 1; Holly's the experienced captain of her team, and needs to plan an upcoming meet with opposing team's captain. She needs to choose what location and which team members will swim which strokes/heats, and notify her team accordingly. 

Scenario 1; Holly works in an office during the week (typical 9-5) and today is Thursday, when, during her lunch break, she goes through her RecSports app to see who her swim team is swimming against on Saturday. She looks at the opposing teams roster and needs to be able to match her swimmers up accordingly to beat the opposing team. One of her swimmers, Barry, just emailed saying that his kid has their own game going on at the time of the swim meet and he can't swim this weekend. He was going to swim M 100 Backstroke, Lane 2 Holly needs to quickly make changes in the schedule and go meet a client all in her hour lunch break.
